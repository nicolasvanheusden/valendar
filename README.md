# valendar

A Flutter project to create a specific calendar for one of my friends.
This calendar must implement the following features : 
    - Days' week on the horizontal axis and names on the vertical one.
    - We can add as many names as we want on the vertical one.
    - Each cell must be an input.
    - There must be 2 calendars : one for adding hours, the other one for adding tasks.
    - There must be a final column calculating the total of hours.
